# @hiryu/paco - a practical parser combinator

## Features

* Type Inference Friendly
    * Current functionality of type inference in TypeScript (v3.0) is limited especially
      about [function combinations](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/10247).
      This library defeats this probelme by using class in some part.
* Tracability
